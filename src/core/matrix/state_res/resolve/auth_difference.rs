/// Get the auth difference for the given auth chains.
///
/// Definition in the specification:
///
/// The auth difference is calculated by first calculating the full auth chain
/// for each state _Si_, that is the union of the auth chains for each event in
/// _Si_, and then taking every event that doesn’t appear in every auth chain.
/// If _Ci_ is the full auth chain of _Si_, then the auth difference is ∪_Ci_ −
/// ∩_Ci_.
///
/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `auth_chains` - The list of full recursive sets of `auth_events`. Inputs
///   must be sorted.
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// Outputs the event IDs that are not present in all the auth chains.
