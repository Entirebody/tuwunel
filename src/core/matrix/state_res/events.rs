/// > `m.room.join_rules`, or a
/// > state event with type `m.room.member` where the `membership` is `leave` or
/// > `ban` and the
/// > `sender` does not match the `state_key`. The idea behind this is that
/// > power events are events
/// > that might remove someoneâ€™s ability to do something in the room.
